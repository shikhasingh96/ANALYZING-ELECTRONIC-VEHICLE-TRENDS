# INTRODUCTION
Over its lifetime an average fuel-based vehicle produces around 16 to 32 metric tons of GHG and consumes 6000 to 7500 gallons of gasoline, which an electronic vehicle strives to reduce. 
In a span of 2-3 years, an EV might reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 2 to 4 metric tons and save 750 to 1,000 gallons of gasoline that would have been consumed by a conventional car.
Purpose of Analysis: It delves into the veracity of the model that companies or suppliers use while distributing the rebate amount that is based on the battery range. 
Objective of the Project: To find best model to determine EV efficiency and promote better decision for customers and manufacturers.

# DATA MINING THROUGH
- Descriptive analysis
- Cluster Analysis: K-Prototype
- REBATE ATTRIBUTION & EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS-Rebate Distribution Discrepancy: Cluster analysis suggests less attribution of rebate amounts to certain models, despite their efficiency in reducing GHG and Petroleum.
  Seeking Enhanced Predictors: Moving forward, our focus is on identifying superior predictors to measure EV efficiency, aiming to align them with the rebate amounts distributed by suppliers.
- Cluster analysis: K-Means (EV_Type)
- Cluster analysis: K-Means (Manufacturer)
- LINEAR REGRESSION MODELING

# KEY FINDINGS AND IMPLICATIONS
Identified Gaps in EV Efficiency Measurement: Discovered crucial gaps in evaluating EV efficiency for suppliers and manufacturers in rebate distribution, influencing customer adoption.
Battery Range as a Limited Predictor: Revealed limitations in using battery range as a sole parameter for correlating with GHG and petroleum reduction.
Efficiency Comparison: Efficiency of Battery-Powered EVs over Plug-in models.
Performance Insights on Manufacturers:   
Leading the Promise: Toyota, Tesla, Honda are aligning with industry promises.     
Underperformance Noted: Kira, Mitsubishi, Jaguar, while surpassing conventional fuel-based vehicles, fall short in delivering the promised value in the EV market. 

# CONCLUSION
Impact of the Project: This analysis offers stakeholders an opportunity to reassess the EV market segment's value, prompting informed decision-making and dispelling misinformed beliefs.
